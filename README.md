# Superheroes of Open Source

### Coding for good, hacking for change!

## Our Mission

We are a group of superheroes â€” open-source coders, ethical hackers, and developers â€” coming together to build projects that make the world a better place. We work in hackathon mode, creating innovative solutions to help those in need, from building apps for social good to providing resources for underprivileged communities.
